# Linear and Logistic Regression

## Introduction
Welcome to the Linear and Logistic Regression! This project is designed to provide an easy-to-use interface for implementing two of the most fundamental algorithms in statistical modeling and machine learning: Linear Regression and Logistic Regression. These techniques are pivotal in predictive analytics, enabling users to model relationships within data and make informed predictions.

Linear Regression is used for predicting a continuous outcome based on one or more predictors, whereas Logistic Regression is used for binary classification tasks. Our toolkit is designed to be user-friendly for both beginners and experienced practitioners in the field.

## Features
- **Linear Regression Module**: Implements linear regression, allowing predictions of continuous outcomes.
- **Logistic Regression Module**: Facilitates binary classification using logistic regression.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Functions to normalize and preprocess your data for optimal performance.
- **Visualization Tools**: Plot and analyze the results of your regression models.
